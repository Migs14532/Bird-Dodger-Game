    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>
      Use <b>W/A/S/D</b> or the <b>Arrow Keys</b> to move your bird up, down, left, or right.<br>
      Avoid all obstacles that appear on the screen.<br>
      Survive as long as possible to achieve a high score.<br>
      You earn points by dodging obstacles and can try to beat your best score.<br>
      The game gets faster the longer you survive.<br>
      <b>Good luck and have fun!</b>
